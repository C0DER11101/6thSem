# Canny edge detector
>The canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images.

Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 5 steps:

1. Noise reduction.
2. Gradient calculation.
3. Non-maximum suppression.
4. Double threshold.
5. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.
