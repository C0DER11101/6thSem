# Simple Image Thresholding

>Thresholding is a segmentation technique used for separating an object from its background.

_The process of thresholding involves comparing each pixel of an image with a pre-defined threshold value; and this type of comparision of each pixel of an image to a threshold value divides all the pixels of the input image into two groups._

_The first group involves pixels having intensity value lower than the threshold value and the second group involves the pixels having intensity value greater than the threshold value._
